# Police-Crime-Rates-vs-City-Budgets

## Background 
The police arrest someone every 3 seconds in the United States. More than 80 percent of all arrests nationwide are for low-level, nonviolent offenses. Nationally, the cost of policing is a staggering $115 billion per year. As a part of society, crime is prevalent all over the world. The purpose of this project is to determine whether or not the crime rate rises or falls in relation to different police variables.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze past and recent crime rates in certain states of the US to determine if there is correlation between certain factors behind law enforcement and the rate of crime in the respective areas.

Questions we hope to answer with the data
- What are the demographics of arrests made by police? 
- Does the city budgets/government police funding have a relationship with poverty level?
- Does the poverty level for certan cities have a relationship with crime rates?

## Machine Learning
Machine learning will be built using Scikit-Learn. Supervised learning with a linear regression model will be utiliezed. This will help transform the data to create an interpretable representation for analysis and to determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification.

### Preliminary Data Preprocessing
Our data consists of three factors. Our independent variable which is the state police budgets and our dependent variables, which are the crime and poverty rates. We will then compare how our independent variable affects the dependent variable using a linear regression model. But before we do that we need to upload our datasets into our database. After joining the datasets we will then connect it to our machine learning model where we chose to do supervised learning with linear regression. 

### Supervised Learning with Linear Regression 
While using Jupyter notebook with the help of SciKit-Learn we were able to create our training datasets to run with our model. We then will use the linear regression model on training data in our dataset to compare if there is or isnt a correlation between the two variables. 

- Pros: 
	- Linear regression is straightforward to use and the output coefficients are easier to interpret
	- Allows us to summarize and study relationships between continuous quantitative variables
	
- Cons: 
	- Linear regression technique outliers can have huge effects on the regression and boundaries are linear in this technique
	- Can sometimes over simplified to capture real-world probelms by assuming a linerar relationship among variables 
	- Outliers can have an significant effect on the output
## Database
We have decided to use PostgreSQL to manage the databases. It will provide support of different functions of SQL like foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, and different user-defined types and functions. It wil be capable of writing large amounts of data more efficiently, and will handle concurrency better than SQL. For our project we joined the county crime rates, county spending, and poverty rates together to create our database. After combining the datasets we were then able to connect it to our machine learning model to run a linear regression to see if there are any patterns within the dataset.

## Dashboard
When creating the dashboard, we decided to use Tableau to help visualize and present our data. The dashboard will consist of a interactive filter that will show case the differences of crime rate depending on which socioeconomic factor the user chooses. The dashboard will also show our machine learning analysis to see which counties are affected the most.
